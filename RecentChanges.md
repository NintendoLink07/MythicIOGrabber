## [3.6.2a](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.6.2a) - 2025-09-15

### Fixed

- [Progress] Characters won't only check for the character with the most raid progress.

- [Progress] Data from RaiderIO will now only be retrieved when there isn't any data yet.
Afterwards it will only refresh upon login in with the specific character.
