## [2.6.0](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.6.0) - 2024-09-18

### Added

- Delve background images have now been added.

### Fixed

- [Raid statistics] Changed the raid stat check from awakened raids to regular raids so Nerub'ar Palace's stats show up correctly.

- [M+ statistics] Changed the order of some code so it won't color the keylevel red when you infact have a key of the same or a higher level timed.

- [ApplicationViewer] The role count in the topright corner should now show the correct count again.

- [PartyCheck] Keystone info now gets populated correctly.
