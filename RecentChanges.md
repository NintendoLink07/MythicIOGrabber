## [2.0.9](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.0.8) - 2024-05-27

### Added

- [Active Queues] Random Battlegrounds now also have a non-rotating background.

- [Active Queues] PVP queues now also have a minimalistic tooltip.

### Fixed

- No more errors should pop up when starting WoW fresh after the cache has been cleared (code checked for an ongoing season but after a cache clear or fresh WoW start after the pc has been shutdown it doesn't have that data right away).
