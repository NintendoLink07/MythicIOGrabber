Happy holidays everyone!

### Added

- You can now add members you've recently invited to your group to be preferred!

These players will show up at the top before other applicants.
They have a golden border so they can be identified quickly.
You can select past applicants in the new "Last invites" panel (click on the vertical "INVITES" button, not sure if I'm a fan of the vertical button, maybe I'll change it up in the next couple of updates).
All preferred applicants are listed in the interface options (accessible with the cogwheel, via Addon Compartment button or just manually going into those options).

Last invited applicants stay in the list for 3 days.
Preferred applicants in the interface options stay there until they're manually deleted via the X button there.
