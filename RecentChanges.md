## [2.0.3](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.0.3) - 2024-05-14

### Changed

- When a group listing does not match your filters anymore the frame in the queue panel will now list a shortened reason.

### Fixed

- Band-aid solution with addons like "World Quest Tracker" that move the search box of the group finder.
After closing all windows that pop up through the quest addons and pressing the search button the search box will appear again.

- Deleted a debug statement that popped up when checking for Blizzard LFG filters.
