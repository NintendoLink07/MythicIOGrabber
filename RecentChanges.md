## [3.5.8](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.5.8) - 2025-08-09

### Added

- The mainframe is now resizable and rescalable.
Resizing can be done via the resize button in the bottom right.
The scale can be adjusted with the input box or the arrows in the title bar.
Some aspects of the UI have to be adjusted to match the capabilites of the frame, e.g. Gearing chart displaying too many row dividers, Progress tab not being designed for a wider frame, etc.
This will fully happen with v3.6.

- [Gearing] Tazavesh Hardmode has been added to the gearing chart.

### Changed

- Swapped the raid buff tracker in the currency panel with the counter for ethereal strands.

- [Gearing] If text is getting truncated it will now show the full text in a tooltip.

### Fixed

- [Ports] The teleport buttons now only get added once instead of everytime you open the mainframe.

- [SearchPanel] The leader badge icon will now also be shown on the signup button when you try to sign up to a group that has atleast 1 leaver.
