## [1.4](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/1.4) - 2023-12-12

### Added

- You can now filter classes and specs!
Instead of the 3 role filter options you have now a filter panel where you can enable or disable what you want to filter.
Obviously if you filter for a healer demon hunter you won't find anything though... probably.

- When there's a player on your ignore list the name is colored in red and the tooltip indicates that the player is on your ignore list.

### Changed

- Number of current applicants is now in the bottom right corner (in the footer bar)

### Known issues

- A premade group of 2 or more members / sometimes even single ones won't send correct spec data to the game client.
Instead of a spec icon it will show a question mark for those groups.
Seems to be a Blizzard bug, unless I find a workaround we have to wait for Blizzard to fix it.
I did report it ingame and on the [official/non-official](https://github.com/Stanzilla/WoWUIBugs/issues/502) github issues page, so now we wait.
