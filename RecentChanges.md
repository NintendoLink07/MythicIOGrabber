## [2.3.1](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.3.1) - 2024-07-19

### Changed

- The new display method has been integrated for the guild panel.
Guild panel is loading much quicker, there is way less lag and when refreshes of the guild members come in there is basically no stuttering at all.

### Fixed

- The position of the raider io panel below search panel frames, applicant frames, etc. has been corrected.

- [Search Panel] The flag indicating the leader should be above the actual leader now (Blizzard changed a function, before it was always the first person).

- [Guild Panel] When the detailed raider io panel is currently open and a guild member info update comes in the panels won't close themselves automatically.

- Memory usage has been lowered by around 2-7 megabytes, depending on how big your guild is and how much raider io information they have.
