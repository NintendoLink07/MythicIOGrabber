## [2.2.1](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.2.1) - 2024-06-28

### Fixed

- [PartyCheck] Itemlevel and durability now also always update for players on your realm.

- [Guild] Saved keystone info from guild members will not have priority over new incoming data.

### Upcoming

- Revisiting my old custom "You've got an invite" panel idea, since I've learned quite a lot since October last year.
Probably implementing it over the next few days, base code is already done.

- After the custom invites I'll probably have a full version of performance optimizing shit, especially a better idea for the guild panel.
