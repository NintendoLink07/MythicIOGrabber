## [3.9](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.9) - 2026-01-26

### Changed

- The [ActiveQueues] panel in the mainframe has been rewritten to be more performant.

### Fixed

- [ApplicationViewer] Fixed multiple errors regarding duplicated code between single and multi and improved performance.

- [FilterManager] If there is only a single group for sorting the [FilterManager] will now work as intended.

- Many layoutIndex order issues have been resolved.

### Known issues

- [Drops] Selecting a Midnight raid or dungeon will not unload the icon and name of the previous shown raid/dungeon boss.
Selecting an encounter fixes this problem for now.

- [Drops] Some loot isn't showing up correctly, e.g. decor and some dungeon loot.

- Many changes have happened in Midnight.
While most have already been fixed before the patch hitting live there might still be some changes that have gone unnoticed.
