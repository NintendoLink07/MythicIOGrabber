## [2.1.2](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.1.2) - 2024-06-09

### Added

- A new tab has appeared!
Partycheck is now available.

Here you will see your group- / raid-members listed in a table, showing info like spec, role, itemlevel, repair%, keystone, score and raid progress.
The table is sortable with 2 active sort methods, e.g. 1. sorted by role and 2. sorted by ilvl.

In version 2.1.3 I'll have missing enchants, missing gems and current talents (not sure what the layout is going to be) for every group member included.

Role and spec are baseline available with WoW.
Ilvl, durability and keystone info are only available if the other player(s) have either MythicIOGrabber or Details installed (or really any addon that used LibOpenRaid).
Score and raid progress are dependant on RaiderIO being installed and them having raider io data.

### Changed

- Changed the Halls of Infusion background image to appear brighter.

### Fixed

- [Main Tab] The "Expand frame" button works again.

- [Search Panel] Adjusted the padding of the group listing frames, since the borders were sometimes wonky.

- [Filter Panel] You can now hide the filter panel when it's currently locked.

- [Adventure Journal] There should be no more errors about the AdventureJournal when lite mode is active.

### Upcoming

- (2.1.3) Condensed Search Panel view: half height versions of the group listings with individual backgrounds (based on the activity).

- (2.1.4) Overhauled main tab layout
