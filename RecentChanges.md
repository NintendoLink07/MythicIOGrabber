## [3.0.1](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.0.1) - 2024-11-03

### Changed

- [ReQueue] The feature will now retrieve the groups you've tried to apply to in order of your signups.

### Fixed

- [Statistics] Raid and PVP panels are accessible again.

- [FilterPanel] Lowered the amount of lag the filter panel produces.
Lags on first open or switching search panel categories and then opening the panel still causes big lags.
