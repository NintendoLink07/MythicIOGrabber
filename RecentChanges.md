## [1.2.8](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/1.2.8) - 2023-11-17

### Known issues

- For some reason a premade group of 2 or more people doesn't send correct spec data to the game client.
So for now it will show a question mark instead of a spec icon 99% of the time.
Will figure this out tomorrow evening.


### Fixed

- (This drives me crazy) Should be no more errors because of the spec id (I really hope so)
