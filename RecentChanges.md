## [3.2.2](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.2.2) - 2025-03-04

### Added

- The currencies in the mainframe have been updated to season 2.

- The background images for the season 2 dungeons and raid have been updated.

### Changed

- [GroupManager] The raid manager frames have been re-enabled, the performance issues should be resolved.

- [GroupManager] The character's guild line has been removed, because the retrieval of guild info has been flaky at best.

- [GroupManager] All members in the normal list are now visually separated.

### Fixed

- Lite mode has been updated / fixed for 11.1.

- Thanks to the new Blizzard performance meters for addons I switched some things around and MIOG's startup lod times have been reduced by a factor of 3.

- [GroupManager] Altered the inspection algorithm, should be more reliable and less performance intensive.
