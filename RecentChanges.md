### Fixed

- [MainFrame] The currencies will stay in their frame like I asked them to.

- [GroupManager] There shouldn't be character name retrieval problems anymore when you're fresh out of a loading screen and in a group.

- [GroupManager] There shouldn't be a 3 to 4 line long progress indicator anymore.
