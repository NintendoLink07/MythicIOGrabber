## [2.3.10](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.3.10) - 2024-08-02

### Changed

- The adventure journal now uses the new display method for many rows of data, basically less laggy, especially when loading loot data.

### Fixed

- [Entry creation] The current Dragonflight raids should now be selectable again.

- [Search Panel] There shouldn't be any more errors when searching for legacy raids and then trying to create a group of any kind.

- Added a lot of TWW map data like boss icons, used in the raid progress info, the journal and the creation of a new group.

- Boss icons in the raid progress info of the raider io panel should be correct icons again and not their encounter journal counterparts.
