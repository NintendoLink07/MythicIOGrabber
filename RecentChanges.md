## [1.4.3](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/1.4.3) - 2023-12-18

### Changed

- Further improvements to performance (the new filter options took quite a toll on the performance).
Per 33 applicants from ~0.088s to 0.071s (fastest compute ever even with data before the new filter options).
Mostly matters when you /reload or join a group that is still listed and looking for members and has already a lot of applicants.

- Improved the raid panel visually (made difficulty borders width / height more consistent).
