## [2.3.7](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.3.7) - 2024-07-28

### Fixed

- There shouldn't be any more errors when queueing for a PVP match.

- The PVP frames in the queue selector should now be visible again and fit within the base frame.

- All rated queues in the queue selector should work again without any errors.

- Deleted season 3 M+ background images.

### Known issues

- Blizzard introduced new Menus with 11.0 and these broke the way I handled canceling PVP queues (since Blizzard doesn't allow that).
Until I come up with a new way to do that you have to click the "X" on the queue frame and then a menu will pop up.
You will have to select the "Leave queue" button of the queue you wanna leave.
This is ONLY for the PVP queues, all the PVE ones still work how they used to work.
