## [2.4](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.4) - 2024-08-10

### Added

- In the toolbar there is a new "More" button.
 This button opens a menu for:
 - the Adventure Journal (where some algorithm improvements come with version 2.5)

 - the basically done DropChecker, where you can select either a slot, an armor type (cloth, leather, mail or plate) or a class/spec and see all the available loot for it.
 You can also just straight up search for the name of the item (description searching is coming with 2.4.1).
 The loot is divided by the individual dungeons and raids and further divided by slot.
 It contains all the TWW world boss drops and both the TWW S1 dungeons and the TWW1 S1 raid.

 - the (not even close to being finished) RaiderIOChecker, where you can input a name and realm (not needed if on the same server) and you'll get all the RaiderIO data they have

### Fixed

- All teleports are now really alphabetically sorted, even when starting WoW again after the cache has been cleared.
