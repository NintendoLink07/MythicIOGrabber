## [3.0.4](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.0.4) - 2024-11-08

### Fixed

- [Statistics] The great vault "timer" will now use a different timing method to make it usable for all of eternity.
It functioned somewhat correctly for the current vault period but won't work for future ones correctly.

- [FilterPanel] When converting my rating filters to Blizzard's rating filters it will now check if the rating checkbox is checked or not
