## [3.5.10](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.5.10) - 2025-08-15

### Added

- An interface option has been added to apply raid graphics automatically upon entering a dungeon.

- Added a tooltip to indicate that you can open the Reshii Wraps UI via the Ethereal Strands icon.

### Changed

- Anything RaiderIO related only checks if there is data from the last 2 raids, since that's the only data RaiderIO provides anyway (to avoid any NP progress showing up).

- Anything RaiderIO related now splits mega dungeons correctly.

- [ActiveQueues] The frame font is now easier to read.

- [ActiveQueues] LFG applications' activity name is now colored so it's easier to read.

### Fixed

- [Progress] Overtime scores now also get shown when you have no intime score.

- [Drops] Waist and leg slots id have been swapped.

- An error occuring when you're in a raid that is not in the current expansion has been resolved.

- An error trying to hide a secure frame while the player is still logging in has been resolved.
