## [3.1.2](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.1.2) - 2025-02-02

### Changed

- [SearchPanel] Switched out the old code for the listing frame generation and implemented the new method I use almost everywhere else.
The search panel should now be lagfree.

### Fixed

- [EntryCreation] The "Faction only" checkbox in the group creator doesn't hover over the "Back" button anymore.

- All relevant PTR data has been added for the new dungeon and the new raid.

- The queue dropdown and the dropdown list can't be clicked through anymore to avoid signing up for group when you don't hit the queue "button"

- Updated the Open Raid library.
