## [3.0.7](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.0.7) - 2024-11-24

### Changed

- Updated A LOT of backend code to match Blizzard's file system names and folders.
Means a less bloated and more reliable addon, 100% coverage of backup files (e.g. new dungeons and I haven't finished the photoshop/upscaling of the background images), etc.

### Fixed

- [RaiderIOPanel] Bosses should now always have an icon set.

- [SearchPanel] When MIOG requests member data of a listing right after a /reload the sorting of members should no longer in very rare cases cause an error.

- Increased performance of certain parts of code.

- Updated the open raid library.
