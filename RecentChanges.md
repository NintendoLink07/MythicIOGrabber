## [2.3](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.3) - 2024-07-17

### Changed

- Switch to a different method of displaying the groups in the search panel, increasing performance by a shit ton.
There should basically be no more micro stutters and scrolling should be buttery smooth.
Throughout the 2.3 version I'll apply it to the whole addon, making it need way less memory and way more snappy.

### Fixed

- [InspectCoroutine - Lite Mode] Various errors have been fixed for lite mode.

- [Category selection - Lite Mode] When trying to look for a group the category buttons should now be visible again.
