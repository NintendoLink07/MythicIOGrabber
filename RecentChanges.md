## [2.9.3](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.9.3) - 2024-10-23

### Added

- [DropChecker] Added filters for the loot so you can check for world boss, BRD anniversary and non-seasonal dungeon loot.

### Fixed

- [PartyCheck] Being in a party where many members join and leave shouldn't create errors anymore.

- [Active Queues] "The Codex of Chromie" will not cause an error anymore (and for that matter no other coming events that are not yet implemented will).

- [Queue Dropdown] Raid finder wings from different raids will now be listed under the same raid.

- [DropChecker] Current seasonal dungeons will not request the loot twice.
