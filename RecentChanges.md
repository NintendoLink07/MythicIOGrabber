## [2.4.9](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.4.9) - 2024-09-04

### Changed

- Updated the gearing chart with the info that is currently available.

- Added the 4 non-mythic+ dungeons and removed the 4 m+ dungeons to/from the DropChecker for now, as soon as S1 starts they'll get taken out.

- Disabled the Guild tab for now, not enough time to really work on it and it's hitting performance quite a lot.
Will revisit this in the future.

### Fixed

- [PartyCheck] Players that are leaving the group won't be checked for gear anymore.

- [Active Queues] Cinderbrew Meadery now has an background image.
