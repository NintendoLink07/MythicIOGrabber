## [2.2.2](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.2.2) - 2024-07-04

### Changed

- The detailed raider io information panel has been simplified, resulting in better performance and a lower memory requirement.
Doesn't save alot of memory (around 1-2 megabytes) but it's the first step.

### Fixed

- The detailed information panel will now display the main's highest raid progress in the raid tab.

- [PartyCheck] Specs and classes will now be identified more reliably.

- [PartyCheck] Weapon enchants will now also be checked.

- [Entry Creation] Setting an mythic plus or pvp rating will not set the other rating to the same value.
