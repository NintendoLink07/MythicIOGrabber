## [3.5.2](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.5.2) - 2025-07-03

### Changed

- The active queues panel has been reworked: performance improvements, design updates and tooltip updates.

- When a dungeon group or raid finder group is being put together by Blizzard (e.g. you're still missing a tank, 2 heals and 7 dps) the queue frame will be updated to reflect that.

- The queue frames will now have the activity's name in the title at the end of the description.

### Fixed

- You can now use the requeue button when you queued for multiple dungeons before.

- Fixed an error where you couldn't view the dungeons of a multi dungeon queue when hovering over the requeue button.

- Clicking the "Queue for multiple dungeons" button is now correctly closing the dropdown menu.

- Previously capped currencies that have been uncapped later in the season won't display the weekly cap anymore.
