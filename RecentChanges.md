## [2.9.1](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.9.1) - 2024-10-22

### Fixed

- The new raid sheet feature won't prolong the loading time of the addon anymore.

- [RaidSheet] Dragging a character and releasing it above it's old space will now correctly set it to this space again.

- [PartyCheck] Changed the algorithm for detecting the unitID back to my version instead of using Blizzard's, mine is more reliable.
