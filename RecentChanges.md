## [1.1.7] - 2023-10-28

### Upcoming

- The whole accept/decline thing is still wonky, since I try to keep the applicants in memory so the addon doesnt compute the full list every time shit happens.
This is going to be the next bigger update I guess.
The next update will probably release the first week in November and for that week and the 1st week of 10.2 I'll heavily update the addon.
After that I'm gonna grind M+ for title so expect less updates (will probably code inbetween dungeons and release a new version when enough changes happened)

Also: I changed from a 5800X3D to a 7800X3D, so performance leaks will be less obvious to me.
If you experience anything odd at all just open up an issue or /w me ingame.


### Added

- Desaturated colors for last tier added, makes it more obvious who had 7/8M and who had 7/8N last tier


### Changed

- Compute time down to ~0.11 ms per 33 applicants on the first run, every refresh or re-apply takes now only ~0.08ms
- Invite/decline logic changed, should be more accurate now (some edge cases where you couldn't invite, decline or both)


### Fixed

- Possible roles of the applicant should now show up again in the detailed view
- Edge cases of applicants reappearing from memory, even when already declined
