## [1.7.1](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/1.7.1) - 2024-01-28

Thanks for 10000 downloads already!
Happy to see players actually enjoying my work.
Please report any bugs either as a comment on the Curseforge page or on the Github issues page, unfortunately I can't test everything by myself.

### Added

- A timeout timer when you apply to a group has been added.

- Dual score checks (min, max) has been added to the filter frame.

### Changed

- Filtering has been made more reliable.

- Lowered the amount of micro stutters.
Already have an idea how to get rid of them completely, will release the new frame system with 1.7.2 at some point this week.

- Decreased the brightness of the color texture of groups you've applied to.
Using a darker green so Monks', Hunters' and Evokers' border doesn't seem to disappear.
 
### Fixed

- Made searching for groups more reliable.

- When you applied to a M+ group and you're currently in the raid panel (or any combination of panel tbh) the group you've applied to will show up (standard Blizzard behaviour, forgot this edge case).

- PVP ordering and displaying of brackets should now work correctly.

- Changing the difficulty with the dropdown should now refresh the result list.

- Improved compatibility with PremadeGroupsFilter.
