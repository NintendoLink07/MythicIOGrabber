## [3.0.10](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.0.10) - 2024-12-18

### Fixed

- Many problems that 11.0.7 introduced have been fixed already.

### Known issues

- Opening up the group finder for the first time in a session might have some serious lag and subsequent openings have a little bit of lag.
This will be fixed in v3.1.0, haven't investigated what's up with that.
