## [2.3.3](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.3.3) - 2024-07-23

### Changed

- The new display method has now also been implemented into the [PartyCheck] tab, less laggy and it won't jump between the M+ and raid tab around anymore

### Fixed

- [Class Panel] The players class is now always visible, instead of just when you're in a group.

- [PartyCheck] The players itemlevel and durability should now always be refreshed.

- [PartyCheck] Party members itemlevel, durability, keystone and keylevel should now be always refreshed when a group update occurs.

- [PartyCheck] The keystone levels should now reflect the level of the keystone, not the players level.
