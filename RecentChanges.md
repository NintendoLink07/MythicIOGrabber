## [2.0.7](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.0.7) - 2024-05-22

### Added

- World PVP and Open World PVP "queues" have been implemented for Active Queues.

### Changed

- [Active Queues] The current group leader's name will be shown instead of "YOUR LISTING".

### Fixed

- [Last Invites] Restored the functionality to the "Last Invites" function and simplified it code-wise, making it easier to maintain in future.

- [Entry Creation] Added the default backgrounds for all PVP categories and questing/custom.

- [Search Panel & Application Viewer] Adjusted the sort button's position to match in both lite mode and normal mode.

- [Application Viewer] Adjusted button sizes so the number of applicants is more visible.

- [Application Viewer] The filters "Affix fit" and "Rating" are now also present in the application viewer.

- [Filter Panel] Party, ress, lust and affix will now also be checked while loading the settings. 

- [Active Queues] There shouldn't be anymore errors popping up being in a currently listed group and being infight.

- [Filter Panel] When using the "linked" option for healer and tanks MIOG won't set Blizzards stock lfg filter to "hasTank" and "hasHealer", since you wanna see both with either a healer or a tank.

- [Filter Panel] Resetting all boss filters via the "X" button now actually resets the setting instead of just letting the borders disappear.

- [Filter Panel] Raid options now also get saved when selecting/deselecting the respective option.

- [Calendar] Adjusted the month day of the calendar functions so it gets all holidays from the current day and not just from the day I implemented the feature...lol
