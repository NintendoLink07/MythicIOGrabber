## [1.2.11](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/1.2.11) - 2023-11-20


### Known issues

- A premade group of 2 or more members won't send correct spec data to the game client.<br>
Instead of a spec icon it will show a question mark for those groups.<br>
Seems to be a Blizzard bug, unless I find a workaround we have to wait for Blizzard to fix it.<br>
I did report it ingame and on the [official/non-official](https://github.com/Stanzilla/WoWUIBugs/issues/502) github issues page, so now we wait.


### Fixed

- Applicants should no longer duplicate when you get a loading screen of any kind.
