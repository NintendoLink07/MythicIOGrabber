## [3.9.5](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.9.5) - 2026-02-26

### Added

- Renown progress bars for Midnight have been added.

- Renown progress bars will now take you to the new Renown panel in the Adventure Journal.

### Fixed

- [Progress] Fixed an error when a RaiderIO m+ score isn't available.

### Known issues

- There are some raids missing when trying to create a group, notably most of the Legion raids.
This is a problem on Blizzards end.
I will add those manually in over the next two weeks, but that's not a high priority atm.

- There is currently an issue with RaiderIO, since they updated their addon last night.
This will be fixed when RaiderIO has pushed an update.
