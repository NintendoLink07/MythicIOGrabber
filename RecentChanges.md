## [1.6.3](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/1.6.3) - 2024-01-15

### Changed

- Active role / class / spec filters will now also filter correctly if any member of a premade group can fill in that role / class / spec (before it would not show the premade group if the leader wasn't eligible).

- Old saved settings that are no longer used / have been renamed should now be deleted from the save files in the "WTF" folder.

- The interface options should now be alphabetically sorted into the addon list.

### Fixed

- UI elements shouldn't disappear anymore if no manual resizing of the frame has been done and you extend the frame via the extend button.
