## [2.3.5](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.3.5) - 2024-07-24

### Changed

- Updated the Open Raid Library.

### Fixed

- [Filter Panel] The raid options will now be populated again (technically the Dragonflight expansion is over so it didn't display any raids).

- [Application Viewer] The number in the bottom right indicating how many applicants you currently have will now be correctly refreshed when displaying the application viewer.
