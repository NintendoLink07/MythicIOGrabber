## [2.9.6](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.9.6) - 2024-11-01

### Changed

- Updated backend code to lower the amount applications and any queue update the "Active queues" panel.

- Disabled the RaiderIO Checker panel for now, has to be remade completely, I hate it.

### Fixed

- The filter panel's input options (e.g. rating, age) will not overwrite settings in other panels anymore.

- [MainFrame] The mainframe will now be actually hiding and showing itself depending on whether it was open or closed before combat had been initiated.

- [MainFrame] The great vault dungeon bar will now show all completed runs that count for the vault instead of just the ones of the current slot.

- [SearchPanel] There shouldn't be anymore errors while trying to sort the members of a group.

- [RaiderIO InfoPanel] The server data will now be refreshed correctly.
