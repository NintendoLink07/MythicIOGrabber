## [1.4.4](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/1.4.4) - 2023-12-19

### Fixed

- Blizzard seems to have fixed the spec id issue.<br>
Have tested it out a lot this morning and each premade sent the correct spec data 100% of the time.<br>
Hurray!<br>

- New applicants should now no longer jump inbetween applicants already in the list.<br>
This way you won't invite someone who just applied while you wanted to invite someone else.<br>
Downside is now the applicant list only gets refreshed when you either press the refresh button or decline / invite someone.<br>
If you don't have invite privileges it will still auto refresh on every new applicant.<br>

### Changed

- Improved performance again by quite a lot!<br>
From ~0.071s to around 0.02s per 33 applicants.<br>
Or in other words: joining a group with 100 applicants now is faster than joining a group with 33 applicants with the old MIOG version.<br>
Makes the lag when you join a group really short.<br>
