### Added

- Flightstones and the equivalent for TWW have been implemented in the currency tracker in the mainframe.

### Changed

- The currencies in the mainframe now have a black semi-transparent background.

### Known problems

- Calendar events are only visible after manually open the calendar frame the usual way (Blizzard changed something in the code so I'll have a look if I can fix that rq).
