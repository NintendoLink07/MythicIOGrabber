## [3.2.4](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.2.4) - 2025-03-07

### Fixed

- [MainFrame] ReQueue groups are now visible again.

- [Progress] Keystone data for the keystone dropdown now always get properly populated.

- [SearchPanel] Bosses that have been defeated but have also an alternative name (Vexie and the Geargrinders / The Geargrinders) will now be more reliably detected.

- [SearchPanel] All unused boss frames will now be hidden when switching categories from "Raids - Legacy" to "Raids".

- [SearchPanel] By default all bosses are assumed to be alive (in the past groups seemed to be fully cleared without any encounter defeated info).

- [FilterPanel] Bosses that have been defeated but have also an alternative name (Vexie and the Geargrinders / The Geargrinders) can now be more reliably filtered out.
