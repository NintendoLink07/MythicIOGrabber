## [2.5.9](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.5.9) - 2024-09-18

### Added

- Implemented the Delves category. 
Background images for the delves will be implemented with v2.6.0.
Gonna investigate if I can check for delve completion and the level of it to display some "progress data" in the app viewer and search panel.

### Fixed

- [FilterPanel] The filter should now catch if you have set a minimum and maximum amount of damagers and no link with another role is active.

- [MainFrame] Hovering over the "Bosses" great vault bar in the topright will not cause an error anymore when you have killed a story-mode boss.
