## [2.0.6](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.0.6) - 2024-05-21

### Added

- Specific battlegrounds have been added to the queue selector!
Due to Blizzard code limitations it has to imitate Blizzards PVP frame:
There will be Blizzards dropdown menu with "Bonus" and "Specific" battlegrounds, choose one and the type of BG appears.
Choose a queue and press the join button.
If I wouldn't have to do it this way I wouldn't, it's part of Blizzard's "let's limit pvp botting" initiative.

### Fixed

- [Active Queues] Ashran and Arathi Basin both have been given the correct background image.

- [Search Panel] No more errors should pop up when no groups have been found and you want to adjust a filter afterwards.

- Deleted all debug prints.
