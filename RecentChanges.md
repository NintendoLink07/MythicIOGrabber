### Fixed

- [UpgradeFinder] Having a shirt equipped won't cause an error anymore.

- [Progress] Raid progress is now properly saved and re-applied on login.

- [SearchPanel] Opening the questing or custom categories won't create an error for specific groups anymore.

- More code changes to split off the custom upscaled images into an own addon to keep the main addons filesize low.
