## [1.2.9](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/1.2.9) - 2023-11-18


### Known issues

- A premade group of 2 or more members won't send correct spec data to the game client.

Instead of a spec icon it will show a question mark for those groups.

Seems to be a Blizzard bug, unless I find a workaround we have to wait for Blizzard to fix it.

I did report it on the official/non-official github issues page, so now we wait [World of Warcraft UI Community Bug Tracker](https://github.com/Stanzilla/WoWUIBugs/issues/502)


### Added

- There's an info icon in the topright corner of the info panel when there are any ongoing issues that are not fixed / fixable until Blizzard fixes it.


### Fixed

- All frame borders should now reset correctly.
