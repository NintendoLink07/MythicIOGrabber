## [1.6](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/1.6) - 2024-01-12

### Added

- You can now right click any player character / players from your party / raid and set them to favoured, so they show up further up in your applicant list next time!
If you've been the leader and you have invited them you can also change them to preferred in the "last invites" panel.
Just click on the black dot and it will change to a checkmark, this means they're saved to your favoured list.
This feature is enabled by default and can be disabled in the inferace options.

- Added a tooltip for the premade texture (in case people don't know what it means).

- The frame can now manually be resized via the button in the bottom left corner above the footer bar (where the browse, delist and edit buttons are).
The new height will be saved in the settings.

### Fixed

- Some errors were popping up if RaiderIO wasn't installed (which you definitely should have installed).

- Improved the spec detection logic.

- Fixed role ordering in the title bar and readded the borders around the spec frames.
