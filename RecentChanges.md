## [3.5.3](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.5.3) - 2025-07-06

### Added

- [SearchPanel] A text indicating the typical keystone range of the leader has been added to the dungeon category.

### Changed

- The vault progress bars have been redesigned to be more in line with Blizzard's design and to display additional data on a first glance:
    - Vault slot unlocks
    - Itemlevel of the vault slot
    The progress bar's will glow and have a checkmark when all slots have been unlocked.

- The mythic plus information (weekly affix, level and name of keystone) have been moved above the vault progress bars and into a single bar.

### Fixed

- Multiple errors relating to data requests have been resolved.

- Small performance improvements when requesting activity data(e.g. dungeon/raid/world boss info).
