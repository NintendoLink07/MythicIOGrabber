## [2.2](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.2) - 2024-06-26

### Added

- A [Guild Panel] has been added!
Here you can see all guild members basic info, their RaiderIO progress (m+ and raid) and their current key and the level of it.
Of course all of it can be sorted.
Since guilds are usually over a hundred members big it might lag here and there if you try to sort the list.

### Fixed

- [Calendar] Guild events between holiday events should no longer cause the holiday info to be discarded.

- [Gearing Chart] The chart fully fits into the actual window.

- [PartyCheck] Reseting a secondary sorting method will not bug out the UI anymore.

- [PartyCheck] Keystones of party/raid members only get checked when you actually switch to the PartyCheck tab.
Decreases lag when calling the main window.

- [PartyCheck] Hands won't be checked for enchants anymore.
