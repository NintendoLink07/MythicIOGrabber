## [2.1.4](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.1.4) - 2024-06-16

### Fixed

- Finally fixed the weird bug where you sometimes (but not always) couldn't upgrade an item when MIOG was enabled.
It was the last instance where I was using a Blizzard dropdown, they're famous for their taint issues.
I am so sorry, lol.
