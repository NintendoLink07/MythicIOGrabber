### Added

- More Devourer specific data have been added.

### Changed

- [Loot] The [Drops] tab has been renamed, rewritten and reenabled.
    - When no filters are active it will always load all raids / dungeons from the current expansion.
    - You can now choose an expansion-wide "All Raids" or "All Dungeons" option.
    - A "Current Season" option wil be implemented over the early access weekend.
    - You can now filter by all the different weapon options and by specific professions.

### Known issues
