## [3.0.13](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.0.13) - 2024-12-27

### Changed

- [MainFrame] Transitioned the queue dropdown to Blizzard's new menus.

- [MainFrame] The requeue button and the cancel buttons on the queue frames have been updated.

- [FilterPanel] When a class/spec filter has been changed the class row will now have a white border to make it visually clear that a filter is active.

- [AdventureJournal] The journal has been disabled temporarily.
The base idea is good, showing you the difference between all difficulties without switching between them and having a M+ keylevel scalar integrated but it currently only works when the text is 100% the same except the number.
This feature will be re-enabled in v3.1.0.

### Fixed

- [ApplicationViewer] M+ applicant entries will now show the correct completed keylevel for your listed dungeon again.
