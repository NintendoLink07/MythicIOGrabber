## [3.1.4](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.1.4) - 2025-02-10

### Changed

- [SearchPanel] Sorting algorithm improved, lag after sorting decreased.

- Anything list that can be sorted (e.g. group finder, application viewer, etc.) now retains its scroll position after sorting (if possible).

### Fixed

- [ApplicationViewer] Decreased the amount of lag sorting a big list of applicant creates.

- [SearchPanel] The number of current listings in the footer bar of the search panel doesn't get updated anymore when switching from the search panel to another tab.

- [Progress] The lag created by switching to the raid progress tab has been eliminated.
