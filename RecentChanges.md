## [2.3.11](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/2.3.11) - 2024-08-05

### Added

- Raid teleports / all other dungeon teleports, including the ones from TWW Season 1, have been implemented.

### Changed

- The teleport page now has the logos of every expansion in front of the button row.

- All teleports are now alphabetically sorted. This unfortunately means that e.g. "The Azure Vault" shows up near the end and not near the beginning of the DF teleports.
