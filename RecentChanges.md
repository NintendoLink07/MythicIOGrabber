## [3.0.13](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/MythicIOGrabber/releases/tag/3.0.13) - 2025-01-06

### Fixed

- [Active queues] Decreased the amount of data that gets refreshed, resulting in a small performance bump.

- [Active queues] The cancel button will not disappear anymore when you have had a manually listed group in the group finder.

- [DropChecker] The search for items will now start at a single character entered instead of two.

- [Options] The "Classic" background option is once again available.

- [ApplicationViewer] The app viewer won't jump into the foreground anymore if the leader edited the listing / relisted the group.

Renamed the "Statistics" tab in the mainframe to "Progress" since there's a lot of change incoming over the next two months and this fits more :).
